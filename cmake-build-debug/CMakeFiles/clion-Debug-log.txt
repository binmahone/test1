The initial target dependency graph is:
target 0 is [libb]
  depends on target 1 [libc] (weak)
target 1 is [libc]
target 2 is [test1]
  depends on target 0 [libb] (weak)
target 3 is [edit_cache]
target 4 is [rebuild_cache]

The side effects are:
target 0 is [libb]
target 1 is [libc]
target 2 is [test1]
target 3 is [edit_cache]
  custom commands
    from target 3 [edit_cache]
target 4 is [rebuild_cache]
  custom commands
    from target 4 [rebuild_cache]

The intermediate target dependency graph is:
target 0 is [libb]
  depends on target 1 [libc] (weak)
target 1 is [libc]
target 2 is [test1]
  depends on target 0 [libb] (weak)
target 3 is [edit_cache]
target 4 is [rebuild_cache]

The strongly connected components for the intermediate graph are:
Component (0):
  contains target 1 [libc]
Component (1):
  contains target 0 [libb]
Component (2):
  contains target 2 [test1]
Component (3):
  contains target 3 [edit_cache]
Component (4):
  contains target 4 [rebuild_cache]

The final target dependency graph is:
target 0 is [libb]
  depends on target 1 [libc] (weak)
target 1 is [libc]
target 2 is [test1]
  depends on target 0 [libb] (weak)
target 3 is [edit_cache]
target 4 is [rebuild_cache]
